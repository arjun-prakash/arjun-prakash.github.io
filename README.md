## Papers
[Clustering volatility regimes for dynamic trading strategies](https://arxiv.org//abs/2004.09963)(submitted) with Gilad Francis, Nick James and Max Menzies: We develop a new method to find the number of volatility regimes in a non-stationary financial time series. We use change point detection to partition a time series into locally stationary segments, then estimate the distributions of each piece. The distributions are clustered into a learned number of discrete volatility regimes via an optimisation routine. Using this method, we investigate and determine a clustering structure for indices, large cap equities and exchange-traded funds. Finally, we create and validate a dynamic portfolio allocation strategy that learns the optimal match between the current distribution of a time series with its past regimes, thereby making online risk-avoidance decisions in the present. 

## Projects

[Mitsubishi Electric](https://www.asianz.org.nz/business/intern-optimizes-life-and-algorithms-in-tokyo/): I spent 3 months in Japan (for the first time), working in the Advanced Machine Learning Division thanks to the Asia New Zealand Foundation. 

Stan Droid(https://bitbucket.org/a-prakash/publicstan/src/master/): A chatbot I made for St Andrew's college to tell the menu, calendar and order food.

[Scopus Miner](https://bitbucket.org/hamishivi/scopusminer/src/master/) with Hamish Ivison, Andrew Campbell and Boris Leung: A tool to extract high quality data from a corpus of abstracts from academic literature, and present the data in a visual and interpretable format. These visualisations may be transferred to other domains of textual information, providing intuitive methods to gain new insight and explore various text-based datasets. 

[DenserFlow](https://github.com/hamishivi/DenserFlow) with Hamish Ivison: Our implementation of base TensorFlow layers!
